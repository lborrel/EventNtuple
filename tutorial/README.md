# TrkAna Tutorial

## Introduction

Welcome to the TrkAna Tutorial! 

The exercises in this tutorial are designed to be self-paced and for both ROOT and python analyzers.

If you have any questions, comments, or feedback, then you can either post on the ```#trkana``` channel of the [Mu2e Slack](https://mu2ewiki.fnal.gov/wiki/Slack), or [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/Mu2e/TrkAna/issues)

## Contents

1. [Preliminary Information](pages/prelims.md): In this exercise, we will get some preliminary information about TrkAna.

1. [Logging In and Setting Up](pages/setup.md): In this exercise, we will log in to the mu2egpvms and set up the environment for the rest of the exercises.

1. [Opening and Inspecting a TrkAna ROOT file](pages/opening.md): In this exercise, we will open and inspect the TrkAna ROOT files.

1. [Plotting Global Track Information](pages/n-hits.md): In this exercise, we will use the ```dem``` branch to plot the number of hits on a track.

1. [Plotting Local Track Information](pages/reco-mom.md): In this exercise, we will use the ```demfit``` branches to plot the reconstructed track momentum at the entrance of the tracker with and without a time cut.

1. [Plotting MC Truth Information of the Track](pages/mom-res.md): In this exercise, we will use the ```demmcvd``` branch to compare reconstructed and MC truth information to plot the momentum resolution at the entrance of the tracker.

1. [Plotting MC Truth Information of the Particle](pages/start-pos.md): In this exercise, we will use the ```demmcsim``` branch to plot the starting position of the conversion electrons.

1. [Plotting MC Truth Information of Ancestor Particles](pages/genealogy.md): In this exercise, we will use the ```demmcsim``` branch to plot the starting position of the muons that generate conversion electrons, and the starting positions of decay-in-orbit electrons.

Incomplete tutorials that have something useful:

1. [Plotting the Time Difference between a Track and CRV hit in the Extracted Position](pages/crv-extracted.md): In this exercise, we will use the ```crvinfo``` branch to plot the time difference between a track and CRV hit in the extracted position. 

Future tutorials:

1. [Plotting the Simulated Energy Loss of Conversion Electrons in the Stopping Target and IPA](pages/tgt-ipa-e-loss.md): In this exercise, we will use the ```demmcsic_stoppingtarget``` and ```demmcsic_protonabsorber``` branches to plot the MC true energy loss of conversion electrons in the stopping target and inner proton absorber.

1. [Making Your Own TrkAna Tree](pages/make-your-own.md): In this exercise, we will make our own TrkAna tree that has a different structure to the default.
